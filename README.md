#AI Chatbot Documentation

Introduction
The AI Chatbot powered by OpenAI is a conversational AI designed to assist users in managing their personal finances. It leverages the OpenAI API to provide intelligent responses to financial queries, offer budgeting advice, track expenses, and give insights into financial trends.

This documentation provides an overview of the chatbot's features, usage instructions, and important considerations for integrating it into your application using the OpenAI API.

Usage Instructions
1. Authentication
To use the Financial Assistant Chatbot, you need an OpenAI API key. Follow OpenAI's official documentation for instructions on obtaining and managing your API key.

2. Making API Calls
Make API calls to OpenAI using the provided API key. Pass the user's messages as input and receive the chatbot's responses in the output.

3. User Interactions
Interactions with the chatbot follow a back-and-forth format. Start the conversation with a system message to set the context for the assistant, and then alternate between user and assistant messages.

4. Handling Sensitive Information
Avoid transmitting sensitive financial information directly through the API. Use a secure method to transmit sensitive data and only pass sanitized, non-sensitive information to the API.

5. Error Handling
Handle API errors and exceptions gracefully in your application to ensure a smooth user experience.
